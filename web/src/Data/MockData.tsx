            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway After its run on Tortola last weekend, the HLSCC Stingrays Spring Volleyball Invitational will conclude in Virgin Gorda this weekend. Debbie Hodge, Director of Student Life at HLSCC, told Island Sun Sports that they’re trying to return sports to the college and one of the sports they decided to focus on was volleyball for both males and females. Students she noted have been practicing and they decided to host the tournament with other teams in the community to give the Stingrays exposure in a tournament setting. She said they looked only at having the female matches on Tortola while coed games will be played on Virgin Gorda. “It was really, really exciting. The students were nervous as first timers but I think we really achieved what we wanted to in terms of them getting a feel of play and what it’s like to play on a big court with seasoned teams, who have been in the sport for some years,” Hodge said. “The camaraderie that was built, the support from the other teams, the encouragement to our students was just overwhelming. They’re really looking forward in terms of moving forward seeing some of those players who played for other teams, coming to HLSCC at our practices and helping to strengthen our team so that in the next round, the scores could certainly look a lot better.” HLSCC fell to Elite 25-4 and 25-3 on Friday. No other results were available. Middle Blocker Anna Gordon who also plays basketball, said it was phenomenal playing again after getting a beating last year. “Getting to see other teams play, I know that I have to work hard, and we’re not going to lose,” she said with laughter. “Even in losing, you have to keep a positive mindset to keep going and even though you’re down by a bit, keep going and keep your teammates positive.” Kristin Abraham, also a middle blocker, said her experience was motivating. “I didn’t expect myself to go in and meet up with the skills that the other teams have, but I was able to see what they did, how they did things, what to expect from other teams as well as what I need to work on as well as cooperating and other skills our coaches taught us during practices before the tournament,” she explained. “Of course I was nervous. But it was a good learning experience.” For Renisha “Ren Pop” Rogers who is into dance and cheerleading, said the sport is new to her but she gets excited to play with her teammates. “It’s not like when you mess up they’re on you back,” she noted. “They’re cheerful and they’re learning too. We’re all learning from our mistakes and accepting our mistakes.” Trevancia “Lil Bit” Lettsome, is the team’s setter and said her experience was fun and a good one. “What I liked about the other teams, they were working with us and telling us what we should and shouldn’t do and I thank them for that because it showed me a lot of things that I can improve on,” she said. Hodge said the weekend games will feature two Bregado Flax coed teams and a team from the community at the Jeffrey Caines Arena, starting with a 5:30 p.m. opening ceremony. Admission is $5 per person. “Come out, enjoy the games and have some good fun with us,” Hodge said. “We just want to see the whole of Virgin Gorda and anybody going to Virgin Gorda from Tortola, this is the place to be, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”",

            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway Legs used a 58-38 Friday night victory over Genesis to even the series, quelling Genesis’ prediction that they would “fry them” and Jason Edwin led the way with 22 points and four assists on Sunday in a 60-42 triumph, to claim the 40+ Basketball League title. Kennedy Bass added 11 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals. Jason Cameron had eight points, four rebounds and three steals. Genesis got 13 points from Royan George and 10 from Jony Asido. Calvin Smith finished with seven points and four rebounds. “Carnel (Cline) had his part to play and this is what he got,” Edwin said, referring to Cline who after winning the opening game 59-53, said Genesis would ‘fry Legs on Friday night.’ “For all the youngsters, never talk before the job is done. Always play the game and let your performance speak for itself.” Steve Parillon added: “Always know we like our legs well done,” he said to Cline. “So don’t talk before the chicken fries properly.” After congratulating Legs, Cline said his team ‘broke down.’ “I thought we had it in the bag from the first quarter, then we just broke down in the third, but we’ll be back later this year, that ain’t the end of us. On Friday, we had a lot of turnovers and when I checked the stats on assists, we had no assists at all. We lost (on) rebounds and we didn’t score like we normally would. But we had a good year. We just weren’t able to secure the goal.” The tournament, he said, works out well for guys over 40 who want to keep their health up to date and reduces the number of guys going to the doctor. Coach Ronnie “Gola” Norman said he heard Cline’s ‘fry Legs’ message, got vexed and told them he’s coming to coach because he didn’t want to hear Cline anymore and wanted to win. “We’re the team who would give out the chat and there’s a man who can’t really play the game that well giving chat,” Norman noted. “It hurt us a lot and it motivated us to win. Tonight, it was more or less the same thing (as Friday), pass the ball inside, take away the two Filipinos points and they couldn’t win, because without their points, they can’t win. In the first game, they had between 30 and 40 points together. One might score but not the two. Once one score, they can’t win.” Parillon said the league needed to merge with the Basketball Federation because organizer Karl “Dub” Scatliffe needs help in making the Tropical Basketball Association stronger. “But leagues like these are very good,” he noted. “If Mr. Scatliffe could get it to a level where one of our 40+ teams can go away and compete, I think it will be good for basketball.” Legs member and Transportation and Works Minister Kye Rymer, praised the league. “This is good for the older gentlemen to keep active, to still compete, have a good time,” he said “I think we need more of this, I like this.”Rymer noted many people didn’t know of the league and suggested",

            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway RTW Falcons batsmen powered their way to 221 for 4, but their bowlers were battered by defending BVI Cricket Association T20 champions Royal Knights on Sunday in Greenland, who flogged them for a six wickets victory. Royal Knights used two half century partnerships to get the job done, chasing down their total in posting 222 for 4, and improved to 2-0. After the Falcons Turby Xavier removed Royal Knights opener Wayne Richards for one, Ryan Mangal and Vivian Fredericks put on a 61 second wicket stand, before Fredericks went lbw for 55 off a Falcons Captain Joel Williams’ delivery. Then Jamal Mickle and Captain Keon DeJesus reconstructed a fourth wicket 77 stand, before Mickle was caught for 40. DeJesus finished with a stroke filled 77 not out and got a supporting 20 not out, from newcomer Richard Francis. Williams’ 57 not out for the 0-2 Falcons, had given them the start they needed along with a supporting 48 from Imran Smith and opener Curtis Jack’s 40. Austin McDowall chipped in a useful 28 and Chad Baston, 24, but all their bowlers gave up 30 or more runs to Royal Knights batsmen. “We won the toss and decided to bowl first but we didn’t restrict them to what we wanted, they made 221,” DeJesus told Island Sun Sports. “Halfway through the game, I told the guys the run rate is just 11 runs, it’s a big score, but it’s simple cricket, rotate the strike, when boundary balls come hit it and we end up victorious.” DeJesus said the Falcons were a good test for his team. “We could have bowled better, but we’re going to fix that in practice,” he noted. “I’m just happy that the batting—Vivian (Fredericks) Mickle (Jamal) myself stood up, contributed and we ended up victorious.” After congratulating Royal Knights, Falcons Captain Joel Williams said they didn’t bowl as planned, started off sluggish and they lapsed on the back end. “From teenage days, they told you catches win matches and that showed today,” he said. “If we had made two of those catches, I think we would have been in for a better chance. Our bowling has been a nickel for us over the years and we have been working on it. It’s just today, it didn’t pay off.” Grenada over Vincy Despite the brilliant bowling of Winston Davis who plucked 5 Grenada batsmen for 40, Vincy suffered a mid-to lower order batting collapse and had an agonizing 68 run loss to Grenada, with Irwin “Small Man” Lewis ripping through their order, taking 4 for 20 along with a maiden when it mattered most, including the wickets of big men, Brent DeFreitas and Earl Prescott for ducks. With Davis taking out Grenada’s Rodney Marryshow for 24, Gary Pierre Prince for 28, Lewis for 22, Emmanuel Charles for 6 and Akeem Hendrickson for 3, Captain Derol Redhead pulled the match from Vincy with an unbeaten 59, to steer them to 179 all out. After Vincy opener McTair James (34) and Monty Butler ( 28) were removed by Marryshow and Lewis—who didn’t get a wicket in the opener against Cavaliers—the Vincy batsmen buckled under the weight of Grenada’s bowling and were out for 111, to lose by 68 runs and fell to 1-1. “It’s another day in the office and we didn’t perform, plain and straight, we didn’t perform as we’re supposed to,” Vincy Captain Cameron Williams said. “We bowled well, but the batting fell apart. We were batting up to par, scoring 11, 12 runs an over up to the 10th over and we fell short.” Grenada Manager Ebony Andrews said she’s happy for the victory, especially after an opening loss to Cavaliers, which is a good comeback and morale booster. “We started off slowly, then we started putting runs on the board , the middle order really kept us together in the batting,” she noted. “In the bowling, I think everybody did a fairly good job today. Out Captain Derol Redhead, though he had an injury to his hand, he was able to make 59 runs. Irwin Lewis took four wickets and brought us up with 22 runs, so I think we did pretty well today.”",

            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway Super Conference Weekend ended with BVI athletes winning 8 medals in 4 different Conferences, claiming 4 National Records, establishing 9 Personal Bests in 2 different sports, Swimming and Track and Field. On the home front, four athletes qualified for the World jr. Championships. Super Conference Gold: Super Conference Weekend began with swimmer Elinah Phillip of Florida International University, winning gold in the Conference USA, 50m Free, in a personal best and National Record time of 22.33 seconds, breaking her previous best of 22.41 at the Big Ten Championships swimming for Rutgers. She advanced to the final with the second best time of 22.64. On the track, Indiana’s Rikkoi Brathwaite, repeated as Big Ten Conference 60m champion, when he broke the tape in 6.57 seconds after advancing to the final with 6.67. He joined Minnesota’s Keita Cline, who won the 1994 and 1995 Triple Jump, as an indoor repeat champion. At the Southland Conference, Diamante Gumbs destroyed his 17.27m previous best, the Northwestern State University, school record of 18.71 and eclipsed Eldred Henry’s 19.56m National Record, to win the Southland Conference, 35 lbs Weight Throw, with a heave of 19.57m (64’2-1/2\"). Besides Henry, he joined Eric Matthias who previously held the National Record at 19.50m, as the third BVI athlete to throw 19.50m or better. Silver: After recording a 49.95 personal best in the prelims, Elinah Phillip picked up her second Conference USA individual medal to go with two relay golds, when she earned 100m Free silver, in a personal best of 49.87 secs. Central Florida’s Beyonce DeFreitas, also bagged silver, when she ran a personal best of 23.65 seconds for second in the American Athletics Conference, 200m. After leading qualifiers in the GLVC 60m, Zara Brown of Southwestern Baptist, was second in the 60m dash in 7.54 secs, after churning 7.47 in the prelims. With his twin brother, conference leader and school record holder Djimon fouling, Diamante Gumbs, stepped up to win the Shot Put crown, by shattering his 15.88m personal best, with a heave of 16.66m (54’8\"). Bronze Competing just 40m mins after the 60m, Brown grabbed 200m bronze in an indoor personal best of 24.90 secs. National Record Utah State’s Xiomara “Gia” Malone, became the BVI’s first athlete to penetrate the 1.70m High Jump barrier, when she tied for fourth in the Mountain West Conference, after scaling the bar at 1.72m (5’7-3/4). Malone who last month broke the 28 year old mark of 1.65m established in 1994 by Virgin Gorda’s Takola Creque, that was tied by Malone’s sister Chantel in 2008 and her former Timber Creek High School teammate Z’Niah “Z” Hutchinson in 2016, cleared 1.66, before her breakthrough jump. Personal Best Akira Phillip, a Javelin Throw specialist, the third BVI athlete at Northwestern State University, eclipsed the 12m barrier for the first time in the Shot Put, when she reached 12.01m (39’4¾”). Eastern New Mexico’s Arianna Hayde, was 5th in the Lone Star Conference Long Jump with a 5.49m (18’0”) effort and was 6th in the Triple Jump with 11.42m (37’5 ¾”). Carifta/World Qualifiers Six athletes met the Carifta Games standard with four of them also achieving World Jr. Championships marks at Saturday’s 5th Dag Samuels Development Series, as U18 and U20 national records also tumbled. Jaleel Croal added the 100m to his World Jr. Championships 200m qualifier, when he bolted to a personal best of 10.41 seconds, (-0.4) the No 4 All Time BVI mark, to take down Rikkoi Brathwaite’s U20 standard of 10.43. Khybah Dawson capped a scintillating combination week of track and field by snatching Keita Cline’s 31-year old U18 Long Jump mark. After a 14.32m (46’11¾”) Triple Jump to win the Elmore Stoutt High School pre-events for O’Neal House, then a 21.79 seconds 200m in the Samuel Series, he joined Croal as the BVI’s 2nd male World Jrs. qualifier, when he cut the sand at 7.58m (24’10½”), to eclipse Cline’s 7.42m (24’4¼”) from 1991. Dawson also broke Cline’s 7.50m (24’7¼”) U20 Jr. Record from 1994. Kaelyaah Liburd and Akrisa Eristee, not only qualified for the Carifta Games, but also World Jrs. Liburd’s 54.76 400m, qualified her for both events, while Eristee added the 200m, ran in 24.32, to her earlier 400m qualifier. Wanyaé Bell grabbed a 400/200m sprint double, with personal records of 48.48 and 21.49 respectively, qualifying for Carifta in both sprints. Jonathan Lynch also qualified in the U18 Boys 800m after running 2:03.26. Khamauri Crabbe dropped a 200m season’s best of 22.03 seconds in winning his heat and was 5th overall in the Spartan Invitational, after finishing 2nd in the 400m he ran in 49.30.

            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway Cavaliers—the BVI Cricket Association 2021 Ten10 champions—overpowered Grenada for a seven wickets victory on Sunday in Greenland, in the Twenty 20 league opener, a rematch of last year’s T10 championships pairings. Cavaliers sent Grenada to bat after winning the toss and restricted them to 93-for-8 in 13.2 overs. Grenada got off to a dismal start with Captain Dave Johnson going for a duck on the second ball he faced. Only middle order batsman Cary Pierre Prince (25) and Emmanuel Charles, (11) could handle the Cavaliers, as five bowlers bagged wickets. Aaron Baker and Avishkar Sewkarran, put on a 54 run partnership to start Cavaliers innings, as they raced to 95-for-3 and a seven wickets victory. Sewkarran had six boundaries for his 37, with a contributing 20 from Jagnarine “Suga” Persaud and a supporting 15 from Baker, the top batsmen. “Today, we did not have a full team and unfortunately, it’s the first day of the cricket season and most of my players had to work, so it was either play or forfeit,” Grenada’s manager Ebony Andrews told Island Sun Sports. “Given it’s the first day, we weren’t going to settle and forfeit, so we decided to come out with the players that we had and still go as hard as we can. I’m always expecting to score more than 94. I’m always expecting to score at minimum, 12 runs an over.” Cavaliers Captain Gopaul Boodram, said although his team did not have much practice, they came out with a game plan and was exceptional. “Based on the talent that our group has, we know that we can deliver on any day,” he noted. “The bowling and the fielding units were exceptional and then we and then we capped it off with the batting, so I’m very happy. We had four run outs in the inning so the fielding was really good. I told the batsmen that bad balls are there so put it away, defend good balls, get singles, fours or sizes, occasionally you’re going to get some wides, so that’s what I told the guys was the game plan.” In the opener, the Vikings using four batsmen scoring at least 32 runs and Man of the Match Collis Fraser bagging 4-for-28, they uprooted Under The Tree for a 75 run victory, after posting 224 and keeping them at bay for 149. “We had a good victory. I think we bowled well coming out on the first match not being fully fit,” Vikings’ Neil “Pow” Niles said. “We bowled well, fielded pretty well and all in all, I think it was a good victory.” Junie Mingo, (40), opener Fraser and Vaden Walker 37 each and Anil Mohibar, 32, were Vikings top batsmen. Sessie Ellis had 44 for Under The Tree, with Shem Ellis adding a supporting 22.",

            "text": "By Dean “The Sportsman” Greenaway Katrina “Kat” Lindsay picked up where she left off last year, by shattering her own Trident Trust 5K Series course record on Saturday, in the first race run under the new sponsors’ banner, which kicked off with 81 participants. Lindsay, who has claimed every record of the series that has tour stops around Tortola in 2021, chopped 31 seconds off last year’s mark of 20 minutes 01.1 seconds, lowering it to 19:31.6. “I didn’t know actually,” Lindsay, 6th overall said when told she improved her mark. “I thought I would try and run a faster time than last year, but I couldn’t remember what the time was because last year, I started getting into the 19s, so I’m happy with that, yeah.” Lindsay said she felt good until going through Lower Estate, where there was a ‘slow steady climb’ on the 4K going up. “I had a couple guys ahead and I tried to stick with them and then we just cruised down Huntums Ghut to the finish, so I tried to hold a decent pace because I thought I was on for a decent time,” she said. “I’ve had a steady build up since Christmas and feeling pretty good, so hopefully, some faster times to come.” Jermaine “JJ” Ricketts was the overall winner in 18:19.7, a time he hoped would have been faster. “The plan was to be the best and win. It was good from the start up to the half and then in the last quarter, I started feeling some stitches in the end,” he reflected. “But I was okay. I just need to keep a steady pace going. Training has been a little different—early mornings, late nights—as much as I can to keep fit and ready for the races.” Julius Farley, second in 18:52.1, said it seems like he can’t adjust. “Don’t mind how many times you run the course, it just seems to get tougher and tougher, but it was a good race,” he said. “I think JJ was taking revenge for the Half Marathon (which Farley won), the way he started out this morning. I tried to keep him in sight, saw him slow down a bit about two and a half miles from the finish, but I still couldn’t catch him. Those young legs. I wish I was his age again man. I was aiming for a better time—maybe go under 18—but I’m satisfied with the time.” U20 National Team Footballer Guillaume Parkins, was 16th overall in 22:56.7 and closely followed by teammate, Sheldon Harry in 17th with a time of 23:00.8. “It was a good run but the 5K is a little bit longer than I thought it would be, but it’s good to do something like this, come out early and you feel fresh after something like that, I can’t wait to do more,” Parkins said. “In football you’re chasing a ball and not constantly running, just waiting for the finish line.” Harry said the pace was fast and he was trying to keep up with the front runners. As they got close, they started separating. “I think this is crucial to my fitness because in a game of football, it’s more about technical ability, it’s more about who could outrun each other and who could stay in the field the longest. I really believe this is propelling my game to make me better in the future.” Jalen Prentice, another teammate, said he had ‘never run a 5K before.’ “It was tiring because when you stopped, you can’t just pick back up, so you have to keep going,” he said. “I think this will help to improve my fitness.” Football fitness Coach Javon Carty noted some of the players went out hard trying to keep pace with the top runners. “It was a good overall run for them—good strength and conditioning—in the early stage of their preparations,” he said. “We have some pictures to show the guys (who didn’t show) and hopefully, they will be out next time—all of them.” Road Racing Director Kay Reddy, said it was a great race as 100 persons registered and 81 participated. “It was really fast at the front, Katrina Lindsay, she didn’t just break the course record, she smashed it,” Reddy noted. “She took 30 seconds off her own record, down to 19:30. We have some new runners at the front pushing the pace so it was a really good race today.” Reddy said it was good to see the U20 footballers who she said were at the front, in the middle and pushing each other. “They were pushing the runners, so it was great to see some camaraderie there,” she said.
